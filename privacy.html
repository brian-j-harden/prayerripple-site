        and any images you choose to attach.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Images and media you upload:</strong>  
        If you choose to attach a photo to a prayer or community post,
        we process the image and store it in your account.

        You explicitly select each photo you upload.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Camera access:</strong>
